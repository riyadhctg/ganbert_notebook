#Instructions
1.   Please follow the instructions from the original git repository
2.   You can upload your data to Colab runtime using the UI. To do this for this notebook, create a folder named "data" in the default colab directory. Then have your three tsv files (labeled, test, and unlabeled) formatted as original Gan-bert data (i.e. QC task), and upload them in the "data" folder you just created
