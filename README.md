# NOTICE
This repo includes a collection of notebooks that runs slightly modified Gan-Bert. There are some modifications to the code to adapt to notebook style execution and different datasets that were used

# Notes
* Each individual notebook includes instructions on how to use them
* Gan_Bert_Colab_Clean.ipynb - is an attempt to run Gan-bert on notebook using the QC data provided in the original Gan-bert repo
* Gan_Bert_3_level_Sentiment_DataFrame_Colab.ipynb - a different dataset is used for three-level sentiment analysis. DataFrame format data was used as inputs. Data, stored as CSV, were loaded from a Google Drive path.
